Time Complexity Comparison-->

Bubble Sort-->

Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)


Quick Sort-->
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2) (rare)



Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred Over Bubble Sort?

Efficiency: Quick Sort is generally faster than Bubble Sort, especially for large datasets. Its average time complexity is
O(n log n), making it more suitable for performance-critical applications.

Performance: While Quick Sortâ€™s worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), it can be mitigated with good pivot selection techniques (like using the median of three method).

Practical Use: Bubble Sort is easy to implement but not practical for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity. Quick Sort, although more complex, is widely used in practice because of its efficiency.
