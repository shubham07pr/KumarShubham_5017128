Analysis:

Time Complexity of the Recursive Algorithm-->

The time complexity of the recursive future value calculation is O(n) because the function makes a single recursive call for each year until it reaches the base case.


Optimizing the Recursive Solution-->

Memoization: One way to optimize the recursive solution is to use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

Iterative Approach: Alternatively, the problem can be solved iteratively to avoid the overhead of recursive function calls.
