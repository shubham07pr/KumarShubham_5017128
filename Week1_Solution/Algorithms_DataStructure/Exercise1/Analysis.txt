Analysis: 

Time Complexity -->

Add Operation: Time Complexity: O(1)
Reason: HashMap's put method has an average time complexity of O(1).

Update Operation: Time Complexity: O(1)
Reason: Updating a product is essentially replacing the existing value associated with the key, which is O(1).


Delete Operation: Time Complexity: O(1)
Reason: Removing a product by key in a HashMap is O(1).



Optimization Strategies-->

Load Factor Management: Ensure the HashMap's load factor is optimized to maintain O(1) performance. Rehashing might be needed when the load factor threshold is exceeded.
Memory Optimization: Periodically clean up unused or stale entries to free up memory.
